We’re proposing to set the ReplicaSet to 1 for a few services in the EKS cluster. The corresponding memory limits per pod are already shared in the Excel sheet — please take a look when you get a chance.

To support this proposal, I’ve also included a snapshot from CloudWatch Metrics that shows the NewFlowCount_TLS metric for our NLB. This metric gives us an idea of how many new TCP connections are being handled — including both actual application requests and health check probes from our monitoring stack.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the key values shown in the chart:

Min: The lowest number of connections seen during the selected time window

Max: The peak number of connections observed

Sum: Total number of new connections (i.e., requests + health checks) over the time period

Average: The average connections during the timeframe

Each row in the table corresponds to a different NLB target (Ingress or App Pod) across AZs, which helps us see how traffic is distributed. Based on the current numbers — with most targets seeing between ~54 and ~98 connections — we believe running a single replica should be sufficient given the memory limits we’re planning.

Let me know if anything looks off or if you'd like to discuss this further.
