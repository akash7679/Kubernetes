Hi Ashish,

Thanks for the note and for the trust you and Steve have placed in my recommendation.

I’m glad Shan can continue in the middleware team, and I’ll make sure we stay on top of things—especially when it comes to avoiding any critical incidents. I completely agree that we need a solid process in place, and I’ll sync up with Ameer to start drafting something that addresses the anomalies we discussed.

Appreciate your support, and I’ll keep you posted as we make progress on this.

Best,
