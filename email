As discussed on the call today, we will be reducing the replica count for Dev and Int (A, B, C) environments, as outlined in the shared sheet. The Accp environment (A, B, C) will remain unchanged, with 2 replicas allocated per application.

Additionally, we will be adding a new node in Prod to handle the Preprod load. For now, the replica count in Prod will be set to 2.
