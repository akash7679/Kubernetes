I want to sincerely apologize for missing the recent production alert. I fully understand how critical it is to respond to such alerts promptly, and I deeply regret that this was overlooked.

This was in no way intentional or taken lightly. Unfortunately, the alert coincided with an unexpected CyberArk access issue and a few parallel tasks that required immediate attention. That said, I take complete responsibility for the miss and fully acknowledge its impact.

This is the first such incident in my time supporting [Client/Project Name] over the past three years, and I’m committed to ensuring it remains the last. I have already taken steps to fine-tune my monitoring approach and add safeguards to prevent a repeat of this situation.

I value the trust you’ve placed in me and remain fully committed to upholding the highest standards of responsiveness and accountability moving forward.


I’m taking this as a serious learning experience and have already made changes to ensure nothing like this happens again. I understand the expectations and the trust placed in me, and I’m committed to not letting this repeat under any circumstances. 
If it ever does, I’ll take full responsibility and will be prepared to accept any action deemed necessary
