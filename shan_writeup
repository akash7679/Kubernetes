I want to sincerely apologize for missing the recent production alert. I fully understand how critical it is to respond to such alerts promptly, and I deeply regret that this was overlooked.

This was in no way intentional or taken lightly. Unfortunately, the alert coincided with an unexpected CyberArk access issue and a few parallel tasks that required immediate attention. That said, I take complete responsibility for the miss and fully acknowledge its impact.

This is the first such incident in my time supporting [Client/Project Name] over the past three years, and I’m committed to ensuring it remains the last. I have already taken steps to fine-tune my monitoring approach and add safeguards to prevent a repeat of this situation.

I value the trust you’ve placed in me and remain fully committed to upholding the highest standards of responsiveness and accountability moving forward.
