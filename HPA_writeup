🧭 High-Level Plan to Enable HPA Across EKS Namespaces (with Monitoring)
Phase 1: Readiness Assessment
✅ Ensure Metrics Server is deployed and operational (kubectl top pods)

✅ Confirm Cluster Autoscaler is configured and node groups are tagged correctly

✅ Identify target namespaces and workloads for autoscaling

✅ Take backup of all existing Deployment YAMLs

Phase 2: Baseline Configuration
✅ Add CPU and memory requests and limits to all containers in targeted Deployments

✅ Use conservative values initially (e.g., 200m CPU, 256Mi memory requests)

✅ Ensure all Deployments are updated in-place without downtime

Phase 3: HPA Creation
✅ Create HPA objects per Deployment using API version autoscaling/v2

✅ Configure dual metrics: averageUtilization for both CPU and memory

✅ Set minReplicas: 1, maxReplicas: 2 to align with capacity policy

Phase 4: Testing, Monitoring & Validation
✅ Use kubectl get hpa and kubectl describe hpa to validate metrics and scaling thresholds

✅ Monitor pod scale-out and scale-in events:

kubectl get events -n <namespace> for scaling logs

kubectl top pods for live resource usage

kubectl get hpa to observe desired vs current replicas

📈 Optional: Visualize scaling behavior using:

CloudWatch Container Insights (for CPU/memory trends)

Prometheus + Grafana dashboards

Kubernetes Event Exporter to send scale events to Slack or ELK

Phase 5: Continuous Optimization
🔁 Review autoscaling efficiency post-deployment

📊 Fine-tune resource requests using Goldilocks or VPA

⏱️ Adjust stabilization windows or scale policies for better control

🚀 Expand autoscaler implementation to more apps and environments
