Hello Steve,

Please find the attached RCA document for your reference.
We are currently working on a revised plan for the upgrade, aligning with GitHubâ€™s recommendations, and will share the details shortly.
Additionally, we are investigating the root cause of the inconsistencies observed between the DR and Production servers.

Thanks and regards,
Akash
